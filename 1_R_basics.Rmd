## 0. Prerequisites:

* install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* install [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/download) (it is not necessary, but RStudio makes a lot of things easier)

## 1. RStudio
RStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming. For now, all you need to know is that you type R code in the console pane, and press enter to run it.
