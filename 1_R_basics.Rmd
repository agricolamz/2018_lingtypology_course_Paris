## 0. Prerequisites:

* install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* install [RStudio Desktop](http://www.rstudio.com/download) (it is not necessary, but RStudio makes a lot of things easier)

## 1. R
To download R, go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Don’t try to pick a mirror that’s close to you, instead it is better to use the cloud mirror, https://cloud.r-project.org.

## 2. RStudio
![]()

RStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming. For now, all you need to know is that you type R code in the console pane, and press enter to run it.
